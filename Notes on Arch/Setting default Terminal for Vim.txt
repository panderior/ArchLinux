# Problem
---------
Eventhough the default terminal for Arch Linux and the Budgie DE I am using is
set to Alacritty (by various means), Vim is still opening with xterm termial.
The problem is how to force Vim to open with the terminal of choice.

---------
# Solution
---------
Edit the </usr/share/applications/vim.desktop> file and change the appropriate
lines.

---------
# Limitation
---------
This solution may not be required if the problem doesn't exist. And this fix 
may not be a general solution for the problem mentioned.

---------
# Steps
---------
    * edit </usr/share/applications/vim.desktop> and change the <Exec> and 
      <Terminal> as following: (NRP)
        # Exec=alacritty -e vim %F
        # Terminal=false


[END]
