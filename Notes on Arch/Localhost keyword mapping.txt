Reference: a question on stack overflow (yeah actually the question itself 
           provided the answer :)
    * https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/422062/why-does-localhost-not-resolve-to-127-0-0-1-on-a-given-port

---------
# Problem
---------
After running a Spring boot application on Apache Server, the <localhost> 
keyword did not work when using HTTPie (a command line HTTP client) to test api
calls, the local ip <127.0.0.1> works, but localhost doesn't.

---------
# Solution
---------
Correct the mapping of the <127.0.0.1> ip and set one of its allias to be 
<localhost>.

---------
# Limitation
---------
This is the simplest problem that could occur related to the localhost errors.
And the solution could already be properly configured on most cases.

---------
# Steps
---------
    * go to the <etc/> directory and open the file <hosts> for editing
    * on the entry (line) of the file that mentions <127.0.0.1>, add the keyword <localhost> as one of the alliases
        $ if that entry doesn't exist, then create it and map it to the keyword
    * save the file
