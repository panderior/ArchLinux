# Problem
---------
After installing Budgie Desktop Enviroment on ArchLinux the default File Manager terminal (on right click menu) becomes gnome-terminal. 
And there is no built-in method to attach another termial to the File Manager (nautilus) right click menu.

---------
# Solution
---------
Install the following packages and add a new entry to the Right-Click for opening terminal on current folder.
    * (pkg-aur) nautilus-open-any-terminal
    * (pkg-official) dconf-editor

---------
# Limitation
---------
This work around seems to apply only for Nautilus File Manager.

---------
# Steps
---------
    * install <nautilus-open-any-terminal> package from the AUR
    * install <dconf-editor> package from Official Arch repo
    * open <dconf-editor> application
    * go to the following folders (menus) in order
        $ com -> github -> Stunkymonkey -> nautilus-open-any-terminal
    * click on terminal menu (option)
    * turn off "Use default value" toggle button
    * in the "Custom value" text box, type in the terminal name (used to start the terminal on a terminal :) )
    * click on "Apply" or "tick (/)" button that you see next to a confirmation message located at the bottom of the screen
    * reboot the system and the "Open <Your-Terminal> Here" entry on the Right-Click menu should appear
