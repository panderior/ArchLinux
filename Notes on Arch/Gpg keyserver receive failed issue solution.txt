---------
# Problem
---------
Updating some pkgs become impossible when the gpg key can't be downloaded by
pacman or yay through the normal process. The pkg update terminates with an error
like "gpg: keyserver receive failed" or "keyserver not responding".

---------
# Solution
---------
Download the keys using <gpg> pkg itself and after confirming the download and import
of the keys, continue the installation or update of the pkg.

---------
# Limitation
---------
If the manual download of the keys with the <gpg> pkg failes, then another solution
needs to be researched.

---------
# Steps
---------
* download the required keys manualy on the cmd using <gpg> pkg
    # gpg --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com <KeyId>
* after confirming the install and import of the key, continue the installation or update of pkgs
